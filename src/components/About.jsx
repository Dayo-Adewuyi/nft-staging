                  <p>
                    In a time long forgotten, whilst the Universe of Magic was the only one  which truly mattered, the dark forces and the Great Wizards collided in the Great Wizarding War! After long and exhausted battles, The War finally ended and the dark forces were defeated!
                    As a follow up, the Great Wizards created The Order of Phoenix, a secret society of witches, wizards, magic birds and creatures whose their sole purpose was to stand against violence, defend humanity and maintain peace in the Universe of Magic.
                    Legendary Owls belong to the Order of the Phoenix, being the first protectors of the Universe of Magic. They watch over the humanity, spreading the values of Bravery, Wisdom, Faith and Compassion to every living being.

                    <br />
                    These values  are crucially important, so KEEP THEM CARVED IN YOUR MEMORY! The secret will be revealed at the right time!
                  </p>
                  <h3>
                    Become a protector and let`s bring LIGHT in this Universe
                    together!
